NzbLiteClient is the official application that implements NzbLite format. Much more than just a traditional Usenet client, NzbLiteClient allows you to upload and download files on newsgroups, encrypt it, and create parity files. The icing on the cake, an NzbLite download link is automatically generated to easily share your files with your friends or on social networks.
